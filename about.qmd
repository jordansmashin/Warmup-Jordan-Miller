Hey there, I'm Jordan Miller, and I'm from Georgetown, Kentucky. Right now, I'm in college pursuing a business administration major and computer science minor. When I'm not working or doing homework, you can find me messing around with resin to make cool furniture pieces. It's a great stress reliever after all the hustle and bustle of life. Even when I start to doubt what I should be doing my family has always been cheering me on and pushing me to do my best, whether it's school or work so that I can always be proud of what I have accomplished.
